<br/>
Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite <a href="http://reddit.com" target="blank">subreddit</a>. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture "prof_pic.jpg" and put it in the img folder. 

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up with a bunch of fontawesome SVGs. Use any of those, or add new customs ones to your static folder!
